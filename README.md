Discussion: 
The Angular FriendlyChat lab for ICT602 was hard but also fun. I learned a lot while working on it, even though I made many mistakes along the way. The first problem I faced was setting up Firebase. I had to create a project in the Firebase Console and enable its services like authentication and the Firestore database. It was confusing because I had to be very careful with things like API keys and settings. If I made a small mistake, the app would not work, and I had to figure out what went wrong.

Another challenge was setting up Firebase Authentication. I had to make sure users could log in and log out safely. I chose to use email/password and Google sign-in methods. Learning how to do this took time because I didn’t know much about authentication before. I also had to test it many times to make sure it worked properly.

Building the Firestore database was also tricky. I had to think about how to organize the data in collections and documents so it would work well with my app. I also learned how to use AngularFire to connect the app to Firebase. Using real-time updates was new for me, and it was hard to understand at first. Debugging problems when things didn’t work was frustrating, but I kept trying until I fixed them.

Even though it was difficult, I learned so much from this lab. I now know how to use Firebase to handle user authentication and real-time database operations. I also got better at fixing errors and understanding how Angular and Firebase work together. This made me feel more confident about working on web apps in the future.

One cool thing I found during this lab was Gemini AI. It was not part of the assignment, but I thought it was very interesting. It made me curious about how I can use AI to make apps smarter. This lab taught me important skills and gave me ideas for what I can try in my future projects.
